# RideKC Streetcar Website

### The Idea

In June 2015, the Kansas City Streetcar Authority [issued an RFP](http://www.kcstreetcar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KCSA-web-RFP1.pdf) for the development of its website. While a KC firm winning this deal would contribute back to the local economy, InnovateKC wants to try a different approach. We believe the incredibly talented and supportive local community will be willing to contribute a beautiful, open-source RideKC Streetcar website. Our goal is to prove to the KCSA that this plan will foster public engagement in new ways and provide a viable means for development and maintenance of the site, all while saving the Streetcar Authority $25,000. This RFP can serve as an example of the sort of innovation that Kansas City needs to become the most entrepreneurial city.

### The Approach

This file will serve as the proposal to the KCSA, so that along with the website even the formal proposal will be open-sourced and driven by the community. By June 30th, the deadline of this RFP, this repository should contain a working website ready to begin the iterative, agile process of refinement with stakeholders. Wanna get involved and be a part of Kansas City's amazing development? Fork this repo, drop in some great code, and submit a pull request!

### The Proposal

To be developed (with your help!)
